      Iâ€™m interested in programming, software development and management. I studied
Computer Science and Business management to gain a good understanding and
knowledge about these respective fields. My goal for the future is to gain further
experience in software development using Agile methodologies. Further down the
road I plan on taking on a larger leadership role
